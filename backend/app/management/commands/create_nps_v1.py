'''
What is this Django command for and how does it work.
This script generates daily meal plans sorted by score attribute.
General idea: we want to make a web app for personalized nutrition which will generate weekly meal plans for each user.
Into a postgres sql database we store the meals into the Meal table. Each meal can be one of the five types (breakfast,
morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner). A daily meal plan is an instance of these five meals. Here comes this
script. To generate a daily meal plan we first filter the Meal table and save the five meals into corresponding lists.
Then, using the product function of the itertools library we create all possible combinations of the 5 meals.
Having the combinations we iterate each one and calculate the total nutrients like total energy, total protein, etc.
Based on these totals and based on nutritional rules we provide a score for each daily meal plan. Finally, we use
the heapq library to create a heap and store the best daily meal plans based on their score and sort the heap from
grater score to least.

Regading the scoring of a daily meal plan. To do the scoring we check the various nutritions if they are between a range or
if they are greater or less than a number.
